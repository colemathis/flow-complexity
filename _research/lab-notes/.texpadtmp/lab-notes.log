Package fancyhdr Warning: \headheight is too small (12.0pt): 
(fancyhdr)                Make it at least 13.59999pt, for example:
(fancyhdr)                \setlength{\headheight}{13.59999pt}.
(fancyhdr)                You might also make \topmargin smaller to compensate:
(fancyhdr)                \addtolength{\topmargin}{-1.59999pt}.
