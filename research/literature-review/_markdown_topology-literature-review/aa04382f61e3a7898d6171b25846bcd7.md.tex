\markdownRendererStrongEmphasis{Summary:} Investigates, using molecular dynamics and Brownian dynamics simulations, the behaviour of chemicals passing moving through porous media and the impact of the environment on molecular diffusion. Concludes that chain length and density, as well as type of molecule, influence diffusion the most.\markdownRendererInterblockSeparator

\markdownRendererUlItem This study investigates how chemicals move through porous media, which can have complex structuresâ€”and can impact molecular diffusion\markdownRendererUlItemEnd 
\markdownRendererUlItem Integrates molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the dynamics at the mesopore level\markdownRendererUlItemEnd 
\markdownRendererUlItem Integrates Brownian dynamics simulations to investigate diffusion at the mesopore and macropore levels\markdownRendererUlItemEnd 
\markdownRendererUlItem Chain length and density greatly influence diffusion coefficients\markdownRendererUlItemEnd 
\markdownRendererUlItem The effective diffusion coefficients were more influenced by the type of molecule than by the surface chemistry\markdownRendererUlItemEnd 
\markdownRendererUlItem These results have implications in designing chromatographic materials, and optimizing separation processes in various fields (pharmaceuticals, environmental engineering, etc.)\markdownRendererUlItemEnd
